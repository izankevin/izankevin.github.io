## Welcome to my personal page
Hello world! I'm Izan Kevin Fernández Tostado. I'm currently studying a Physics BSC at _Universidad Autónoma de Madrid_ (UAM) [more info](https://secretaria-virtual.uam.es/doa/consultaPublica/look%5bconpub%5dBuscarPubGuiaDocAs?entradaPublica=true&idiomaPais=es.ES&_anoAcademico=2021&_centro=104&_planEstudio=448).

I'm interested in Theorical Physics and I also love programming. 

I'm part of _Nemesis Studio_, a non-profit project created by 3 friends where we build a game called _Georush_ (not avaible yet to the public) after we were awarded in a game creation competition carried out by the _Universidad de Almería_ (UAL) [more info](https://w3.ual.es/eventos/jornadasinformatica/ualGames/index.shtml). This project gave us some important values of team working and experience in game development, thanks to this we also were invited as speakers in the conference _Jornadas de Autoempleo_ (2015) at the same university, UAL
### Programming Skills

- MATLAB/GNU Octave: I learned how to code in Matlab at the course _Computación I_ obtaining a calification of 9.3, acquiring experience in numerical analysis, data analysis and numerical simulations. I've been using this programming language for data analysis in every laboraty I've worked in as part of the Physics BSC, _Técnicas experimentales I, II (with honors), III (with honors)_.
- C++: I learned how to code in C++ at the course _Computación II_ obtaining a calification of 9.3, learning more numerical analysis techniques and data analysis.
- ROOT-Framework: 
- LaTeX: I learned how to make scientific documents such as articles and slides at my own. Currently I have advance skills in LaTeX documents, usings several libraries such as Bibtex or Pgfplots(for making vectorial graphs inside a LaTeX document).
- Python: I learned how to use Python for fun. 
- Linux: I'm used to work in Linux-based distributions, currently I'm using Ubuntu as my default OS.
- Office: Advanced skills in both the Open Document Foundation and Microsoft ofimatic suite.
